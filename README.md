# Efficient Algorithms to Mine Maximal Span-Trusses From Temporal Graphs

Code of the paper ["Efficient Algorithms to Mine Maximal Span-Trusses From Temporal Graphs"](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.01928.pdf).

## Compiling
`g++ file.cpp -std=c++11 -O3 -o file`

## Datasets
More datasets available upon request.

## Reproducibility and alternative implementations
[Marco Rubini](https://github.com/marcorubini) re-implemented the code of the algorithms presented in the paper, you can check his repository [here](https://github.com/marcorubini/span_trusses) for a more readable code and possibly faster execution time.
